A discord bot that talks to the Factorio-Zone API so anyone can start a Factorio Zone server instance without having to figure out user specific cookies.

If you want this to work for yourself, simply add a "tokens.py" file, and structure it like this:
USER_TOKEN = "your factorio zone user token"
DISCORD_TOKEN = "your bot token"

Then run main.py and you're good to go.
